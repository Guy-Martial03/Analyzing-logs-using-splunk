# Analyzing-logs-using-splunk
The goal of the project is to analyze logs from various sources (Firewall, Applications, Protocols, System) using Splunk.

Splunk is a software platform used for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data, such as logs, in real time. It functions as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, helping organizations detect, investigate, and respond to security threats.

# Projects
# - Network Logs (Protocols)
1- Analyzing DNS Logs Using Splunk: This project provides a step-by-step guide for analyzing DNS (Domain Name System) log files using Splunk. It covers uploading sample log files, extracting relevant fields, analyzing DNS query patterns, detecting anomalies, and monitoring DNS traffic.
2- Analyzing FTP Logs Using Splunk: This project guides you through analyzing FTP (File Transfer Protocol) log files using Splunk SIEM. It includes steps for uploading sample log files, extracting fields, analyzing FTP activity patterns, detecting anomalies, and monitoring FTP traffic.
3- Analyzing HTTP Logs Using Splunk : This project outlines the process of analyzing HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) log files using Splunk SIEM. It covers uploading sample log files, extracting relevant fields, analyzing HTTP request patterns, detecting anomalies, and monitoring HTTP traffic.
4- Analyzing SSH Logs Using Splunk: This project provides a comprehensive guide for analyzing SSH (Secure Shell) log files using Splunk SIEM. It includes steps for uploading sample log files, extracting fields, analyzing SSH activity patterns, detecting anomalies, and correlating SSH logs with other data sources.
5- Analyzing Tunnel Logs Using Splunk: This project demonstrates how to analyze tunnel log traffic (e.g., GRE, IPv4, IPv6) from Zeek IDS using Splunk SIEM. It covers uploading sample log files, performing analysis, detecting anomalies, and correlating tunnel logs with other logs for enhanced threat detection.
6- Analyzing SMTP Logs Using Splunk: This project provides a structured approach for analyzing SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) log files using Splunk SIEM. It includes steps for uploading sample log files, extracting fields, analyzing email traffic patterns, detecting anomalies, and monitoring SMTP activity.
7- Analyzing DHCP Logs Using Splunk : This project offers guidance on analyzing DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) log files using Splunk SIEM. It covers uploading sample log files, extracting fields, analyzing IP address assignments, detecting anomalies, and monitoring DHCP traffic.
